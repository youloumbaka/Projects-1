# Title

# Abstract
You have probably already heard the quote "we are what we eat" which is already a quick data analysis, most of the time referring to a link between the quality of our health and the quality of the food we eat. With a food inspection dataset, we hope to find out the relation between food quality and different locations (in the city of Chicago in our case). To conclude, we would like to go into a deeper analysis providing an understanding beyond geography by locally linking food industries to social status. 

# Research questions
Is there a relation between facility types and locations ?
What facilities are the most inspected ? What are the most often violations per location ?
What are the violations with the highest risk level ? Are they linked to a location in particular ?
Based on the questions above, can the local food avaialable define a location alone ? In case of yes, how can we justify it ? Or in case of no, what proves it wrong ?

# Dataset
We are going to use the Chicago Food Inspections dataset. We expect it to mainly show us the connections between locations and the risks (which is a direct link to quality). Then we will need more resources/research to link those locations to types of communities, which people live/frequent these places and a general socio-cultural vision based on location which will enable us to link alimentation and social status.
